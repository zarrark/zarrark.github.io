# SDGs Overview

The United Nations Development Programme proposed 17 Sustainable Development Goals [(SDGs)](http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals.html) which came into effect in January 2016. The 17 SDGs are shown in Figure 1 below. Further details, reports and official UN resolutions are also available as listed in the library (@UNDP_SDGs,@UN2016_SDGIndicators,@UN2015_SDGagenda,@UNDP2015_SDGbooklet,@UN2017_SDGIndicators,@UN2017_SDGsreport2017,@SDSN2017_SDGIntSpillovers).
