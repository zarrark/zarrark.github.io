This flag was adopted on February 12, 1812, four years before Argentina declared independence from Spain in 1816. The "Sun of May" design was added to the flag in 1818. The blue and white colors were chosen by Manuel Belgrano, the leader of the Argentinian revolution against Spain, and represent the blue sky parting to reveal white clouds in memory of the Liberation demonstration which began in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on May 25, 1810.@WorldAtlas2018_Argentina
